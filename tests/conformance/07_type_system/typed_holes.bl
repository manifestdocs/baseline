// Conformance: typed holes (??)

// Typed holes produce HOLE_001 warnings during type checking.
// At runtime, they produce an error if reached.

// Hole in a let binding with type annotation
fn hole_with_annotation() -> Int = {
  let x: Int = ??
  x
}

// Hole as function body
fn hole_as_body() -> String = ??

// Hole in conditional branch (unreachable at runtime if condition is always true)
fn hole_in_branch(x: Int) -> Int = {
  if x > 0 then x
  else ??
}

// Test that the reachable branch works fine
test "hole in unreachable branch" = hole_in_branch(42) == 42
