// Test file for effect checking
// This file contains intentional effect violations

// Function declares {Log} but calls Http.get! which requires {Http}
fn process!(data: String) -> {Log} String = Http.get!(data)

// Function with no declared effects calling effectful operations
fn fetch_data!(url: String) -> String = Http.get!(url)

// Correct function - effects properly declared
fn correct_fetch!(url: String) -> {Http} String = Http.get!(url)
